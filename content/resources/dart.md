Dart is the programming language used on both Flutter and AngularDart. Developed by Google, it aims to enable developers to build complex and high-performing apps. One advantage of using Dart is that you can build your business logic once and use it on both mobile (Flutter) and web (AngularDart) applications. You can even use Dart server-side as well.
