Flutter SDK is an open-source mobile app SDK created by Google. Flutter SDK allows you to build an app using a single codebase that can be compiled to both Android and IOS. It is also used to build applications for Google Fuchsia OS. 

You write your Flutter applications using a programming language called [Dart](/resources/dart). Unlike other solutions which uses a bridge, your Dart code gets compiled to machine code. This gives you the advantage of having native performance for your app.

Here is a growing list of Flutter resources I have found online. I hope these will help you get started and also improve your Flutter skills.
