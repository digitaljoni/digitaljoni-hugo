The following slide was part of my talk last March 2020 which gives a fun look at object-oriented programming in Dart. I used familiar anime characters to illustrate object features of the Dart language.

Imagine you were given the task of creating an RPG set in the world of Dragonball Z and your task was to program the Saiyan characters of the game. Saiyans are powerful beings from another planet that serves as the main characters of the series.

Slide 2

To make things simple, we represent a Saiyan object with two properties: the character's name and character's amount of power. And we give the character a few methods to punch, kick and do a special move. We also customize the toString() function to output the name and power.
