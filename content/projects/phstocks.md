### Why I Built The App
If you are a busy person (i.e. a full-time employee or a student), you wouldn't have the time to go your stock broker's site daily to check the latest changes to your stocks. 

I built this app out of necessity... I wanted a way to track stock prices quickly. I didn't need the latest up-to-the-minute updates... just what are the latest prices at that day. If the time and price is just right, then I will find a moment to go to my stock broker's site to either buy or sell. 

### API Used
The app uses the Simple PSEi (formerly known as PHISIX) RESTful API (http://phisix-api4.appspot.com/). This API provides list of stocks traded in PSE and latest stock prices changes.
